            <i>
            
        The Quran is the most sacred text for the Islamic religious tradition, as it is considered the direct unedited word of God revealed to the prophet Muhammad.
         The prophet Muhammad was shown the Quran around the 7th-century C.E in the Arabian Peninsula, near the revered city of Mecca.

         The Quran is sometimes spelled as Koran.
        The prophet Muhammad recited the words he heard in their exact order. 
        The Quran has a unique rhythmic and expressive style; this allows it to be easily memorized.
         During the period that the Quran was revealed, oral transmission and memorization were the norms, as writing scarcely existed.
         It was encouraged by the prophet Muhammad's companions to learn the ayahs and spread them amongst the community. 
         Memorization of the Quran is known as the Hifz. Pronunciation is an area of study known as Tajweed. Tajweed focuses on clarifying how letters and words must be pronounced in addition to the context. 
         Muslims of various countries, cultures, and languages can recite the Quran in its original form of Arabic. 
         The Quran has been translated into over 100 languages.

            DIFFERENCING QURAN AND HADITH
        </h2>
    </header>
    <pre>
        <h3>
        Quran is the holy book of the Muslims that is considered to be the word of God. 
        The religion or faith called Islam is totally based upon this holy book. Many people remain confused between the Quran and Hadith,
         the sayings and rituals that have clouded the understanding of the text contained in Quran.
         Hadith are mainly the sayings and teachings of the prophet Muhammad that are very similar to what is contained in Quran. 
         This article attempts to clear the confusion by highlighting the differences between Quran and Hadith.

QURAN
The sacred writings of the faith of Islam revealed by Allah to Prophet Muhammad are contained in a book called Quran or Koran.
 The word Quran literally means recitation, and the book is a compilation of what the almighty revealed to Muhammad.
  Quran is the leading light of the Muslims around the world and it has been there for more than a thousand years
   helping adherents of Islam to lead a good and chaste life that is according to the commandments of the almighty.
   Obedience to these commandments in oneâ€™s life leads to salvation.
    Following the principles of Quran ensures a rich and rewarding life on this planet.

HADITH
Hadith is a collection of sayings and teachings of the prophet Muhammad. 
It is the most important source of religious laws of Islam. Hadith are written by scholars who were born later than the Prophet, and there are differences in their memories, intellects and their interpretations of what the prophet said or gave approval.
 Hadith are ascribed to Muhammad Saheb and play an important role in the interpretation of Islamic laws.
  Hadith were compiled in 8th and 9th centuries, but the two main sects of Islam, the Shia and the Sunni, have different interpretations of the same Hadith.
 Hadith describe the actions, habits, statements and tacit approval of the prophet to the actions or behaviors of others in front of him.
